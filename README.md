### Algorithm and Data Structure in Python
This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures in Python. The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of algorithms and data structures that are easy to understand and implement. The algorithms and data structures are implemented in Python and are accompanied by a README file that explains the algorithm and data structure in detail.

This repository is split into three sections:
- Easy
In this section, you will find algorithms and data structures that are easy to understand and implement. These algorithms and data structures are a good starting point for beginners.

- Medium
In this section, you will find algorithms and data structures that are a bit more complex than the ones in the Easy section. These algorithms and data structures are a good starting point for intermediate programmers.

- Hard
In this section, you will find algorithms and data structures that are more complex than the ones in the Medium section. These algorithms and data structures are a good starting point for advanced programmers.

### Style Guide
The style guide for this repository is based on PEP 8. The style guide can be found [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
